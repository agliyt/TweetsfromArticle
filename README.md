This Chrome extension helps the user discover what other people are talking
about the content they’re currently reading. It does this by getting keywords
from the webpage they’re on and displaying Tweets with these keywords as
hashtags.

Add this to your Chrome extension by downloading this code, turning on
developer tools at chrome://extensions, and click "Load unpacked" to try it
yourself.
